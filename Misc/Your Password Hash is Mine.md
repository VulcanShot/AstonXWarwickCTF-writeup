# Your Password Hash is Mine!

## Solution

We are given some stolen credentials:

> steve:b3bd446fc33849ff7b454d5615f407fa70520fb3dde46893fea2292b5f8f1848

The first part seems to be the username of poor Steve, and the second one is the password hash. You can use an online hash cracker like [this one](https://crackstation.net/) to get the **flag**.
